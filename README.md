# non-paraxial-beam-propagation-code
This is a Fortran code for free space/medium propagation of a nonparaxial Gaussian beam.
The code is based on the algorithm mentioned in the paper by Malakuti et al. Applied Numerical Mathematics
Volume 61, Issue 7, July 2011, Pages 891-899
There is also a .plt file for plotting the longitudinal profile of the field for the parabolic_wave_guide_1D.f90 code.
